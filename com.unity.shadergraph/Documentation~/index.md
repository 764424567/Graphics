## Description

A **Shader Graph** enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network. The graph framework gives instant feedback on the changes, and itâ€™s simple enough that new users can become involved in shader creation.

For an introduction to **Shader Graph** see [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md).

**Shader Graph** is available via the Package Manger window in Unity versions 2018.1 and higher. If you install a prebuilt [Scriptable Render Pipelines]() such as the [Universal Render Pipeline]() or the [High Definition Render Pipeline](), **Shader Graph** is automatically installed in your project. It is not recommended to install or update **Shader Graph** indepedently of the prebuilt render pipeline packages. 

**Note:** Shader Graph builds shaders that are compatible with [Scriptable Render Pipelines](), including the prebuilt [High Definition Render Pipeline]() and [Universal Render Pipeline]() made by Unity. Shader Graph is not compatible with the built-in render. 

**Note:** **Shader Graph** package versions compatible with Unity Engine 2018.1 and higher are considered *Preview* versions. Bug fixes or features will not be maintained on those versions. To work with an actively supported version, use Unity Engine 2019.1 or higher.
